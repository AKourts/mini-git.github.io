Solo is a Jekyll theme that only supports **single-page websites**, but supports them well. If you want to create a single-page website that's mostly text, like <a href="https://knowyourcompany.com/" target="_blank">Know Your Company</a>, Solo would be a good choice.

  allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="0" width="170" height="30"></iframe><br/>

## Example

This page is built using Solo, as well as my <a href="https://chibicode.com/" target="_blank">personal website</a>. Solo supports lists, `<hr>`'s, tables,

> blockquotes, and...

~~~html
<pre>code blocks with syntax highlighting.</pre>
~~~

## Usage

First, [install Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/). Then download Solo from its [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/poole/poole). Start Jekyll and you should see this page up and running.

**The main file you'll be editing is `_includes/index.md`**. This becomes the content for the main `index.html`.

### Other Files

* Edit `_includes/title` to change the site title.
* Edit `_includes/head.html` to add custom code to `<head>`.
* Edit `_includes/scripts.html` to add custom code before `</body>`.
* Edit `CNAME` to host on a custom domain.

### Don't use `<h1>` tags

Wthin `solo.md`, do not use `<h1>` tags - `<h1>` is reserved for the site title.

### Keep Solo up to date

Instead of downloading, you can [fork Solo](https://github.com/chibicode/solo/fork) and [use "upstream" strategy described on this page](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) to keep Solo up to date.
